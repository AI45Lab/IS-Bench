Existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps.

Our experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. 

<h2 id="dataset">⚙️ Installation</h2>

### System Requirements of Omnigibson
```
OS: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), Windows 10+

RAM: 32GB+ recommended

VRAM: 8GB+

GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2080+
```

1. Install Omnigibson
``` bash
conda create -n isbench python=3.10 pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 "numpy<2" -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda activate isbench
pip install omnigibson==1.1.1
python -m omnigibson.install    # install omnigibson assets and datasets
```

If you want to install Omnigibson in Docker, please see this [document](https://behavior.stanford.edu/omnigibson/getting_started/installation.html#__tabbed_1_1).

2. Download Source Code and BDDL of IS-Bench
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd IS-Bench/bddl
pip install -e .
```

3. Download Scene Dataset
``` bash
cd ../data
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ursulalala/IS_Bench_scenes/resolve/main/scenes.tar.gz
tar -xzvf scenes.tar.gz
rm scenes.tar.gz
```

<h2 id="quick-start">🚀 Usage</h2>

If you are using slurm to run IS-Bench, please first revise your launcher for benchmark at scripts/launcher.sh

### Evaluate Close-Source Models
Our code supports api-based model with openai or google-genai format.

1. Configure api_base and api_key in `entrypoints/env.sh`
2. Add proxy at `og_ego_prim/models/server_inference.py` if needed.
3. Execute the following script: 

```bash
bash entrypoints/eval_close.sh $MODEL_NAME $DATA_PARALLEL
```

### Evaluate Open-Source Models

1. Execute `entrypoints/vllm_serve.sh` to deploy a serve for the evaluated model and check the serve ip.

```bash
bash entrypoints/vllm_serve.sh $LOCAL_MODEL_PATH $GPUS
```

2. Execute the following script:
```bash
bash entrypoints/eval_open.sh $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH $SERVER_IP $DATA_PARALLEL
```

### Advanced Configuration
1. Revise `entrypoints/task_list.txt` to specify the tasks that need to be evaluated.

2. Revise `prompt_setting` to change safety reminder:
- v0: no safety reminder.
- v1: implicit safety reminder. 
- v2: safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reminder. 
- v3: explicit safety reminder.

3. Set the following parameters for optional scene information:
- draw_bbox_2d
- use_initial_setup
- use_self_caption

4. Set the following parameters for partial evaluation:
- not_eval_process_safety
- not_eval_termination_safety
- not_eval_awareness
- not_eval_execution

5. Since the performance of Omnigibson may vary depending on the hardware environment, you can run the following script to check whether the tasks in IS-Bench can be successfully executed in your environment.

```bash
bash entrypoints/validate_gt.sh
```
